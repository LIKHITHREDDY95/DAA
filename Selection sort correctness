Loop Invariant
A loop invariant is a condition that is true at the beginning , end of each iteration of a loop. a loop invariant to prove the correctness of the selection sort 
Before the i-th iteration: The first i elements of the array are sorted in increasing order.
Before the first iteration (i = 0): The array is empty, so the invariant holds correct .
Assume the invariant holds before the i-th iteration.
During the i-th iteration:
We find the minimum element in the unsorted array i to n-1
We interchange the minimum element with the element at index i.
The first i elements are still sorted (since we swapped the minimum element with the element at index i).
The (i+1)-th element is now the smallest element among the remaining elements.
Therefore, the invariant holds for the (i+1)-th iteration.
Termination
After the (n-1)-th iteration: The entire array is sorted, as the invariant guarantees that the first n-1 elements are sorted and the last element is the largest.
